  # VerifyMC v1.2.3 Release Notes
  
  ## 🔧 Folia Compatibility Fixed
  
  ### Fixed Issues
  
  - **Player Kick Crashes**: Fixed `IllegalStateException: Player is already removed from player chunk loader` error
  - **Plugin Startup Failures**: Fixed `UnsupportedOperationException` error, plugin now starts properly on Folia
  
  ### Solutions
  
  - Use `PlayerLoginEvent` to intercept players during login phase, avoiding chunk loader conflicts
  - Auto-detect Folia environment and disable incompatible async tasks (whitelist.json monitoring, version reminders)
